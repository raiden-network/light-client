  Raiden Light Client CLI
  <br/>
</h2>

<h4 align="center">
  Node.js command line application using the <a href="https://github.com/raiden-network/light-client/tree/master/raiden-ts">Raiden Light-Client SDK</a>
</h4>

The goal of the CLI is to provide a HTTP REST server that is fully compatible with the [Raiden API specification](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest_api.html). It uses the Raiden Light Client SDK internally.

The CLI is considered experimental and mostly used for testing internally, not yet stable enough for production usage. Be aware that not all endpoints the specification defines are implemented yet.

It requires the latest [Node.js LTS (14.x - Fermium)](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

> **INFO:** The Light Client SDK, dApp and CLI are **work in progress** and can only be used on the Ethereum **Testnets**.

## Requirements for Safe Usage

- **Layer 1 works reliably:** That means that you have got a web3 provider (eg. MetaMask) that is always synced and working reliably. If there are any problems or bugs on the client then Raiden can not work reliably.

- **Persistency of local DB:** Your local state database is stored in your browser storage (IndexedDB). This data should not be deleted by the user or tampered with in any way. Frequent backups are also recommended. Deleting this storage could mean losing funds.

- **Dedicated account for Raiden:** We need to have a specific Ethereum account dedicated to Raiden. Creating any manual transaction with the account that Raiden uses, while the Raiden client is running, can result in undefined behavior.

- **Raiden account has sufficient ETH:** Raiden will try to warn you if there is not enough ETH in your Raiden account in order to maintain your current open channels and go through their entire cycle. But it is your job as the user to refill your account with ETH and always have it filled.

- **Raiden always online:** Make sure that your node is always working, your network connection is stable and that the Raiden node is always online. If it crashes for whatever reason you are responsible to restart it and keep it always online. We recommend running it inside some form of monitor that will restart if for some reason the Raiden node crashes.

- **Ethereum client always online:** Make sure that your Ethereum client is always running and is synced. We recommend running it inside some form of monitor that will restart if for some reason it crashes.

- **Ethereum client is not changed:** Swapping the Ethereum client while transactions are not mined is considered unsafe. We recommend avoiding switching Ethereum clients once the Raiden node is running.

- **Raiden REST API is never exposed to the public:** For Raiden's operation, the client needs to be able to sign transactions at any point in time. Therefore you should never expose the Raiden Rest API to the public. Be very careful when changing the `--rpc` and `--rpccorsdomain` values.

## Try it out

### Build the SDK
```sh
yarn install  # install/update SDK's dependencies, if needed; it'll also build the SDK
```

The SDK transpilation can be quite heavy on memory. If you are building on low-end devices and get out-of-memory errors on the build step, try increasing memory or swap size. Optionally, you can build the SDK on a more capable machine (even of different architecture) and copy/rsync `dist` and `dist:cjs` output folders to `../raiden-ts`.


### Build the CLI
```sh
yarn workspace raiden-cli build # build the dependent output
yarn workspace raiden-cli build:bundle # build the bundled output
```

The `build` script will output `./build/index.js`, which requires that the dependencies are in place in the `../raiden-ts/node_modules`, `../raiden-ts/dist*/` and `./node_modules/` folders.
The `build:bundle` script will output `./build/bundle.js`, which depends only on `*.node` native libraries copied to the same output folder, therefore is a portable bundle which can be moved around (as long as the native libraries are in the same folder).

Again, if getting out-of-memory errors, you can build these files on a more capable machine, just be careful to copy the correct native libraries to the output folder if on a different architecture (e.g. copy `./node_modules/wrtc/build/Release/wrtc.node` to `./build`)

### Run the CLI

You can see a summary of the options:
```sh
node build/index.js --help
# or
node build/bundle.js --help
```

The CLI currently exposes parameters to configure the Raiden node that runs behind the REST service.

To run the CLI for the very first time, the only two thing necessary are a keystore file and an Ethereum node.

```sh
node build/index.js -e https://provider.web3:8545 -k /path/privkey.json
```

This starts the Raiden node and connects to a REST interface. The state is stored in `./storage` as JSON files. It is expected that the account is already funded with ETH to pay for on-chain transactions.

### Documentation

The [Raiden API documentation](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest_api.html) describes the available API endpoints and provides example requests and responses.

Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. Refer to the

codestyle, patterns and quality requirements. Although this is still more
experimental and internal than SDK and dApp, questions and issues can be
reported in the issue tracker.
