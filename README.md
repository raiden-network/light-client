The Raiden Light Client is a [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network) compatible client written on JavaScript/Typescript, capable of running in modern web3-enabled browsers, wallets and Node.js environments.

The Raiden Wallet is a reference implementation of the Raiden Light Client, which can be used with web3 wallets like Metamask (Desktop) or imWallet (mobile).

## About The Project

<!-- Explain Raiden? -->

There is already a Raiden client available, which has been [released for mainnet in December 2018](https://medium.com/raiden-network/red-eyes-mainnet-release-announcement-d48235bbef3c). However, we want create an easy to use Light Client SDK, which can be integrated by any JavaScript developer to make it easier to send tokens through the Raiden Network.

Here's why:.
* You should be able to interact with the Raiden Network easily with your dApp.
* We want you to be enable your users to make token transfers using their consumer wallets like imToken or Metamask.
* It should be possible to send tokens using low end devices.
