 * Public exposed channels interface (Raiden.channels$)

 * This should be only used as a public view of the internal channel state

 * Most relevant are:
 * - state: one of 'open', 'closing', 'closed', 'settleable' or 'settling'
 * - id: channel identifier
 * - token: ERC20 token contract address
 * - tokenNetwork: TokenNetwork contract address
 * - settleTimeout: number of blocks after close when channel becomes settleable
 * - openBlock: block number in which channel was opened
 * - closeBlock: block in which channel got closed
 * - partner: partner's address
 * - balance: how much was sent (negative) plus received on this channel from partner
 * - capacity: how much still can be transferred through this channel; increases with deposit
 * - Balances [for each property, prefixed with either 'own' or 'partner']:
 *   - Deposit: on-chain totalDeposit
 *   - Withdraw: on-chain totalWithdraw
 *   - Unlocked: how much was received and unlocked on this channel's end
 *   - Locked: how much is still locked off-chain on this channel's end
 *   - Balance: received minus sent off-chain
 *   - Capacity: channel end's liquidity
 *   - Withdrawable: amount which can still be withdrawn
