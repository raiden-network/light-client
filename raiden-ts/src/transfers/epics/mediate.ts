/**
 * When receiving a transfer not targeting us, create an outgoing transfer to target
 * Mediated transfers are handled the same way as unrelated received & sent pairs. The difference
 * is that we don't request the secret (as initiator would only reveal to target), and instead,
 * wait for SecretReveal to cascade back from outbound partner, then we unlock it and reveal back
 * to inbound partner, to get its Unlock.
 * If it doesn't succeed, if we didn't get reveal, we'll accept LockExpired, if we did and know
 * the secret but partner didn't unlock, we register on-chain as usual.
