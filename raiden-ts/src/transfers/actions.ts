/**
 * A transfer async action set
 *
 * A transfer is considered as having succeeded from the time the secret is revealed to the target,
 * as from there, target and mediators can claim the payment down to us. But the full off-chain
 * happy case completes only after partner/neighbor acknowledges receiving the Unlock.
 * So, we usually only emits this action in the end of the happy case, and it'll then contain the
 * unlock's balanceProof, which indicates the full off-chain path succeeded.
 * It'll be emitted without a balanceProof if something forces the transfer to complete
 * (e.g.  channel closed), the secret was revealed (so target was paid) but for any reason the
 * unlock didn't happen yet.
 *
 * transfer.failure is emitted as soon as we know the transfer failed definitely, like when a
 * RefundTransfer is received or the lock expires before revealing the secret. It notifies the user
 * (e.g. pending Promises) that the transfer failed and won't be paid (eventually, locked amount
 * will be recovered by expiring the lock).
