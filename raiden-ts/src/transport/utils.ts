 * as it needs to also be the initial mapping for the scan itself, so instead of pipe+startWith,
 * as we usually do with state$, we need to get the initial value as parameter when it's used in
 * withLatestFrom in some inner observable

 * @param action$ - Observable
 * @returns Observable of aggregated Presences from subscription to now
