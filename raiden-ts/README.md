The Raiden Light Client SDK is a [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network) compatible client written in JavaScript/Typescript, capable of running in modern web3-enabled browsers, wallets and Node.js environments.

> **INFO:** The Light Client SDK, CLI and dApp are all **work in progress** projects. All three projects have been released for mainnet and all code is available in the [Light Client repository](https://github.com/raiden-network/light-client). As this release still has its limitations and is a beta release, it is crucial to read this readme including the security notes carefully before using the software.

## About The Project

The [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/) is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments. Itâ€™s complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token.

The Raiden client code is available [here](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden) and has been [released for mainnet](https://medium.com/raiden-network/alderaan-mainnet-release-announcement-7f701e58c236) in beta state as part of the Alderaan Raiden Network release in May 2020.

The main entry point of the SDK is the `Raiden` class, which exposes an `async`/promise-based public API to fetch state, events and perform every action provided by the SDK on the blockchain and the Raiden Network.

Internally, the SDK architecture is a Redux-powered state machine, where every blockchain event, user request and off-chain message from other Raiden nodes and service providers follows an unified flow as actions on this state machine. These actions produce deterministic changes to the state and may cause other actions to be emitted as well. Asynchronous operations are handled by a pipeline of [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org) epics, an [RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/) async extension for Redux which unleashes the power, versatility and correctness of observables to Redux actions processing. These epics interact with the blockchain through [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) providers, signers and contracts, allowing seamless integration with different web3 providers, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). Redux state is persisted using [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), with `indexedDB` as backend on browsers, if you use the `raiden-dapp`, or `LevelDown` if used with `raiden-cli` on NodeJS. Tests are implemented with [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

External off-chain communication with the Raiden Network is provided by a dedicated federation of community-provided [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) homeservers, accessed through [matrix-js-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk), and [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) for fast p2p communication.

A technical deep dive into the SDK architecture, technologies, tips and details on the design goals and decisions can be found in the [SDK Development](https://github.com/raiden-network/light-client/blob/master/raiden-ts/SDK-Development.md) document. Reading it is highly recommended to anyone wishing to better understand how the Raiden Light Client works under the hood or to contribute to it, though not required to use this library as a dApp developer.

## Requirements for Safe Usage

- **Layer 1 works reliably:** That means that you have got a web3 provider (eg. MetaMask) that is always synced and working reliably. If there are any problems or bugs on the client then Raiden can not work reliably.

- **Persistency of local DB:** Your local state database is stored in your IndexedDB storage on browser environments, and local LevelDown database folder on NodeJS environments. This data should not be deleted by the user or tampered with in any way. Frequent backups are also recommended. Deleting this storage could mean losing funds.

- **Raiden account has sufficient ETH:** It is your job as the user to ensure your account has enough ETH at all times when some on-chain transactions needs to be performed. Most of those are on-demand/interactive, but some may be required as a reaction to some non-interactive event (e.g. registering the secret for a received but not unlocked transfer).
